# ENS NAME FINDER

The goal of this project is to create an ENS lookup service that can search thousands of different names with certain expressions.

Different expression ideas:

"TEXT" + (any number or letter) i.e. (TEXTa,TEXTb,TEXTc)<br>
"TEXT" + (any number or letter) + "TEXT" i.e. (TEXTaTEXT,TEXTbTEXT,TEXT1TEXT) <br>
- The above would both just allow a user to enter a * anywhere <br>

"TEXT" + (0 to 10 of a certain character) i.e. (TEXTA,TEXTAA,TEXTAAA) <br>

Other options:

- Different combinations of text
- Find the shortest name containing text
-
